# avcbasic
A programming language inspired by TinyBASIC that compiles to AVC2 assembly.

See [spec.md](spec.md) for a formal grammar and specification.

The AVC2 implementation used for testing this compiler is [here](https://github.com/mathmaster13/avc2). It is a fork of the reference implementation with some bug fixes.
